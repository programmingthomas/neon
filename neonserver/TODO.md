#Todo
This file contains a list of things that I still need to add support to the server side for:

* Generic database system with more advanced inheritance so that adding and saving functions can be simplified
* A way of queueing database save operations so that they can happen after the user has requested the page
* Like/dislike
* Finishing off documenting all the API functions accurately - perhaps godoc could be used to generate the documentation directly from the Go code?
* More organisation of the API
* Security fixes so that all input (NAMES!) gets validated
* Create cache folders for the images so that we can test without committing the files that we generate?
* Wonderfully simple (and fast) Markdown support. I had thought about creating a generic heirarchial structure by parsing the Markdown and then applying some simple rules although I'm not convinced that this will be particularly quick
* -Server side logout-

Also, I like Hans Zimmer, and Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor are pretty good as well
