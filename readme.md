#Neon

Neon is a new project that allows schools to implement an educational micro blogging virtual learning environment with ease. Think of it as a mix of Twitter, Tumblr, the circles from Google+ and Moodle.

The name stemming from the idea of a particle and how it is all interconnected yet intellectual.

The project all uses Node, client side JS and some really neat JS. Or at least it will once we get coding!

##Installation instructions
To start, run node index.js

Easy to add paths with handle["/request"] = requestHandlers.path; in the index.js file, just make sure to define handlers in handler.js

Response body can be inline or using an external file

Currently supports POST requests

##The growing todo-list that will one day get shorter (hopefully)

TODO:

- GET requests
- AJAX integration with JSON
- Database integration (decide which one to use, god damnit!)(MySQL)
- Public API?
- Everything else?!
