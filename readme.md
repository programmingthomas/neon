#Neon
Neon is a new project that allows schools to implement an educational micro blogging virtual learning environment with ease. Think of it as a mix of Twitter, Tumblr and Moodle.

The project all uses Node, client side JS and some really neat JS. Or at least it will once we get coding!

##Installation instructions
To start, run node index.js

Easy to add paths with handle["/request"] = requestHandlers.path; in the index.js file, just make sure to define handlers in handler.js

Response body can be inline or using an external file

Currently supports POST requests

##The growing todo-list that will one day get shorter (hopefully)

TODO:

- GET requests
- AJAX integration with JSON
- Database integration (decide which one to use, god damnit!)
- Public API?
- Everything else?!
